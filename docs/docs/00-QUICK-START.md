## Core Concepts to Understand

### 1. Subscription Tiers & Quota System

**How It Works**:
```
User sends message
    ↓
Check quota: messagesUsed < messagesTotal?
    ↓
   ┌─────┴─────┐
   ↓           ↓
  Yes          No
   ↓           ↓
Allow      Show Upgrade Prompt
   ↓
Increment quota
   ↓
Monthly reset (1st of month)
```

**Tier Limits**:
| Feature | Freemium | Premium | Smart Premium |
|---------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Messages | 20/month | 200/month | Unlimited |
| Video Calls | 1/month | 2/month | 4/month |
| Call Duration | 15 min | 25 min | 25 min |
| Nutrition | 7-day trial | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Chat Attachments | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Second Intake | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

### 2. Nutrition Expiry (Freemium Only)

**Timeline**:
```
Day 1: Generate plan → Trial starts
Days 2-4: Full access (no warnings)
Day 5: Blue banner "2 days left"
Day 6: Orange banner "1 day left"
Day 7: Red banner "Last day!"
Day 8+: Locked screen → Upgrade required
```

**Implementation**:
- `generatedAt` timestamp stored on plan creation
- `expiresAt` = generatedAt + 7 days
- Check on every nutrition screen load
- Premium+ users: `expiresAt` = null (unlimited)

---

### 3. Injury Substitution Engine

**How It Works**:
```
User opens workout
    ↓
Load exercises
    ↓
For each exercise:
  Check against user injuries
    ↓
  Contraindication found?
   ┌─────┴─────┐
   ↓           ↓
  Yes          No
   ↓           ↓
Show warning  Continue
   ↓
Auto-open alternatives modal
   ↓
User selects safe alternative
   ↓
Exercise substituted
```

**Example**:
- User has **knee injury**
- Workout includes "Barbell Squat"
- System detects "squat" keyword
- Shows alternatives: Leg Extension, Wall Sit, Hip Thrust
- User selects "Leg Extension"
- Squat replaced, reason logged

---

### 4. Two-Stage Intake System

**Flow**:
```
New user verifies phone
    ↓
First Intake (3 questions)
   - Gender
   - Goal  
   - Location
    ↓
Check subscription tier
   ┌─────┴─────┐
   ↓           ↓
Freemium   Premium+
   ↓           ↓
  Home    Second Intake (6 questions)
               - Age
               - Weight
               - Height
               - Experience
               - Frequency
               - Injuries
                ↓
          Calculate Fitness Score
                ↓
               Home
```

**Why Two Stages?**
- First intake: Quick onboarding (all users)
- Second intake: Detailed profiling (Premium+ incentive)
- Drives conversion: Freemium → Premium

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Fitness Score Calculation
```typescript
Base score: 50
+ Experience: 0 (beginner), 15 (intermediate), 30 (advanced)
+ Frequency: (workoutDays - 2) × 3
- Age factor: -5 if < 20, -1 per 5 years if > 45
- Injuries: -5 per injury (max -20)
- BMI factor: -10 if underweight/obese
= Final score (0-100)
```

### 2. Macro Calculation
```typescript
1. BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor)
2. TDEE = BMR × activity multiplier
3. Adjust for goal:
   - Fat loss: TDEE × 0.80
   - Muscle gain: TDEE × 1.10
   - Maintenance: TDEE × 1.00
4. Protein: 1.8-2.2 g/kg
5. Fats: 27% of calories
6. Carbs: Remaining calories
```

### 3. Injury Substitution
```typescript
1. Check exercise name against avoid keywords
2. If match found → flag exercise
3. Look up injury rule
4. Filter alternatives by muscle group
5. Return 3-5 safe alternatives with reasoning
6. User selects → update workout plan
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I migrate this to React Native?
**A**: Yes! All specifications are platform-agnostic. Use:
- Document 3 for screen layouts → React Native components
- Document 2 for data models → AsyncStorage or Realm
- Document 5 for algorithms → Port to JavaScript

### Q: Can I use a different database (MongoDB, MySQL)?
**A**: Yes! SQL schemas provided convert easily:
- PostgreSQL → MySQL: Minimal changes
- PostgreSQL → MongoDB: Convert tables to collections, adjust relationships

### Q: Is the translation data included?
**A**: Translation keys are referenced throughout, but the full 2,904-key translation file should be extracted from `/components/translations-data.ts` in the original React app.

### Q: How long to implement from scratch?
**A**: Estimated **14 weeks** with 2-3 full-time developers:
- Weeks 1-2: Database + Auth
- Weeks 3-6: Core features (Intake, Workout, Nutrition)
- Weeks 7-10: Advanced features (Injury engine, Ratings)
- Weeks 11-12: Coach/Admin tools
- Weeks 13-14: Polish + Testing

### Q: Can I add new features not in the spec?
**A**: Absolutely! The architecture is designed to be extensible:
- Add new injury areas to substitution engine
- Add new subscription tiers
- Integrate wearables (Apple Health, Google Fit)
- Add social features (friend challenges, etc.)
