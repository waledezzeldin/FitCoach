# FitCoach+ starter repo

This archive contains a lightweight starter scaffold for FitCoach+:
- backend (Express-like stub with Agora token + recommendations endpoints)
- mobile (Flutter minimal app with screens)
- admin (Next.js starter)
- infra (docker-compose for local dev)
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions skeleton)

Replace placeholders in `.env` files and run the local instructions in `infra/docker-compose.dev.yml` and subfolders.
