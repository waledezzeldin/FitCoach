## Strategy Update

Due to the large size of the remaining files (02-06 are 8,000-15,000 words each, totaling 50,000+ words), I'll use an efficient batch approach:

1. Use file system commands to copy files to new locations
2. Update references in batches using search/replace patterns
3. Delete old files after verification

---

## Next Steps

1. Copy remaining 6 files to their new Phase folders
2. Update all cross-references in one batch
3. Update INDEX.md and README files
4. Verify all links work
5. Delete old files
