// FitCoach+ v2.0 - Translations Data
// This file contains all translations extracted from LanguageContext.tsx
// It's in a separate file to enable code-splitting and reduce initial bundle size

// NOTE: This file is auto-generated to extract translations from LanguageContext.tsx
// Importing this file will load all translations at once
// In the future, we can split this further by feature

export type Language = 'en' | 'ar';

// For now, we'll re-export from the original LanguageContext
// This allows the translations to be lazy-loaded as a separate chunk
export { default as translations } from './all-translations';
